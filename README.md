## About the app

**Exportify** is a web application written in React, with lambda functions providing backend endpoints that communicate with the Spotify API.

The app can be used to query public Spotify playlists by their shareable URL, but users can also choose to log in with Spotify and retrieve their own private or saved playlists.

I built the skeleton of a similar tool in March 2022 for learning and personal use; I wanted to keep text backups of my own Spotify playlists. My original tool had the very unimaginative name of "Spotify Playlist Exporter", and was built in vanilla JavaScript as I hadn't started learning React at that stage.

I've learned a lot since 2022, so I wanted to produce a better version which was more reliable and implemented the React learning I've done since then. I also wanted to try out a few new React concepts with this project as well.
